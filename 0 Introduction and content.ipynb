    "Welcome to our Big Data & Analytics project - a project about stock recommendations using big data. Stocks are traded every day, and traders use information about stocks, such as fundamental data to make decisions on whether to buy, sell or hold a stock. This information is available in large quantities, so it is impossible for the individual trader to process all of this information and include it in stock buying decisions. In order to solve this problem we built a Machine Learning Algorithm with Python to predict as to whether it is worth buying, selling or holding a share today to make a profit in a certain amout of time."

Once the data understanding increases - usually through pattern recognition in the data, triggered by viewing the model output - more detailed models can be developed. Moreover, the division of data into training and test sets is another requirement for the modeling phase."

    "- **Deployment:** Data mining, on the one hand, can be used to verify previously established hypotheses and on the other hand, to discover new - sometimes unexpected but useful insights. Through the knowledge discovered in the earlier phases of the CRISP-DM process, sound models can be obtained that may then be applied to business operations for many purposes, including prediction or identification of key situations. These models need to be monitored for changes in operating conditions, because what might be true today may not be true in the future. If significant changes happen, the current model should be replaced by a new, more accurate one. It is also highly recommendable to record the results of data mining projects so documented evidence is available for future studies."
